The Hologram network is device-agnostic. All you need to get online
is an activated Hologram Global SIM Card and a cellular device or modem.

### APN Settings

If you don't already have one, order a Hologram Global SIM Card 
from [our online store](/store). Then, activate your Hologram Global 
SIM Card on [our Device Dashboard](https://dashboard.hologram.io).

With your device **powered off**, insert the Hologram Global SIM
Card into your device and power your device back on.

Then, all you need to do is configure your device to use Hologram's
Access Point Name (APN) to load the proper configuration.
Consult your device's documentation on how to configure the 
APN.

The correct APN settings are as follows:

* **APN:** `hologram`
* **APN username:** *(none)*
* **APN password:** *(none)*
* **IP Address:** *Dynamic (using DHCP)*
* **Data Roaming:** *Enabled*

That's it! Your device should now be connected to the Hologram cellular network.

### Huawei E303 USB Modem

The Huawei E303 USB modem is an extraordinary cellular
modem for development and testing work. You can buy the E303 from
[our online store](/store).

Our [E303 Guide](/docs/guide/connect/e303) describes in more detail the process
of connecting via this modem.
