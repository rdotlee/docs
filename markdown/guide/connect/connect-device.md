The Hologram network is device-agnostic. All you need to get online
is an activated Hologram Global SIM Card and a cellular device or modem.

We sell USB modems on [our online store](/store) that can be used with any
computer or Linux-based embedded device. See our 
[USB modem guide](/docs/guide/connect/usb-modem/) for details.

### APN Settings

If you don't already have one, order a Hologram Global SIM Card 
from [our online store](/store). Then, activate your Hologram Global 
SIM Card on [our Device Dashboard](https://dashboard.hologram.io).

With your device **powered off**, insert the Hologram Global SIM
Card into your device and power your device back on.

Then, all you need to do is configure your device to use Hologram's
Access Point Name (APN) to load the proper configuration.
Consult your device's documentation on how to configure the 
APN.

The correct APN settings are as follows:

* **APN:** `hologram`
* **APN username:** *(none)*
* **APN password:** *(none)*
* **IP Address:** *Dynamic (using DHCP)*
* **Data Roaming:** *Enabled*

That's it! Your device should now be connected to the Hologram cellular network.
