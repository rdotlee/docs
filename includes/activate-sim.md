Every SIM card has an 18-22 digit unique ID printed on it. Enter your SIM's ID
in the activation form.

Then, choose your data plan and zone according to your needs. If you aren't sure
which plan is right for you, start with pay-as-you-go. See our [pricing
page](https://hologram.io/pricing/) for more details on plans and zones.
